# Welcome to the Xamarin Community Toolkit Documentation

The Xamarin community toolkit is a collection of reusable elements for mobile development with Xamarin.Forms, including animations, behaviors, converters, effects, and helpers. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks when building iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps using Xamarin.Forms.

## Contributing

Do you want to contribute or update the docs? Read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

When opening a PR, start by forking this repository. Then, you'll need to create a new branch from the `master` branch.

We will periodically merge updates from the live branch to master to keep master in-sync with the published docs.  When we make a new release, we will push master to the live branch in order to publish documentation for new features.
