# Xamarin community toolkit

The Xamarin community toolkit is a collection of reusable elements for mobile development with Xamarin.Forms, including animations, behaviors, converters, effects, and helpers. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks when building iOS, Android, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps using Xamarin.Forms.

The Xamarin community toolkit is available as a Visual Studio NuGet package for new or existing Xamarin.Forms projects.

## Open source

The Xamarin community toolkit is built as an open source project hosted on GitHub by the community. Its source code can be in the [Xamarin community toolkit repo](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit).
