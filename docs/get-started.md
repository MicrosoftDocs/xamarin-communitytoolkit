# Getting Started with the Xamarin Community Toolkit

The toolkit is available as a NuGet package that can be added to any existing or new project using Visual Studio.

1. Open an existing project, or create a new project using the Blank Forms App template.

2. In the Solution Explorer panel, right click on your project name and select **Manage NuGet Packages**. Search for **Xamarin.CommunityToolkit**, and choose the desired NuGet Package from the list.

3. There's no need to reference the toolkit in your XAML pages as we're sharing the namespace definition with Xamarin.Forms.

    * In your C# page, you can add the namespace to the toolkit:

        ```c#
        using Xamarin.CommunityToolkit;
        ```

4. Check out the rest of the documentation to learn more about implementing specific features.
